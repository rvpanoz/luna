## Luna - npm management through a modern UI.
npm desktop manager for handling npm dependencies. Build on Electron :hibiscus:


### Motivation

Luna was created with main purpose to handle and install npm dependencies in a ease way. It provides a useful and modern UI in order to enhance the user experience. In addition I wanted to create a project with the latest web technologies combined in one application. 


### Features

- Manage global and local packages
- Search npm for new packages
- Install/Update/Uninstall packages
- Uninstall packages
- Update existing packages
- Filter packages by type or outdated
- Preview package details (versions, statistics, dependencies and more)
- Get notifications for missing dependencies or extraneous dependencies
- Run npm tools like npm audit
